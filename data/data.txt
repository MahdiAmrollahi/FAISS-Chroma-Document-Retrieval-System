Neural Networks: An Overview

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They are a subset of machine learning and form the foundation of deep learning algorithms.

How Neural Networks Work:

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each connection has a weight that adjusts during training. The network processes input data through these layers, applying transformations and learning patterns.

Key Components:
- Input Layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden Layers: Process the data through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or classification
- Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Loss Functions: Measure prediction accuracy
- Optimization Algorithms: Update weights (Gradient Descent, Adam, RMSprop)

Types of Neural Networks:

1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
   - Simplest type, data flows in one direction
   - Used for basic classification and regression tasks

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   - Specialized for image processing
